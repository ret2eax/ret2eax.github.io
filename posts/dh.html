<p>#[ DESCRIPTIVE REFERENCE ] :</p>

<p>Diffie–Hellman key exchange was one of the first public-key protocols as originally conceptualized by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. Traditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical channel, such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. The D-H protocol therefore provides a secure alternative to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.</p>

<p>#[ PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION ] :</p>
<p>Where <b>m</b> is Alice's private key, and <b>mG</b> is her public key. And where <b>n</b> is Bob's private key, and <b>nG</b> is his public key.</p>
<pre class="hack dark">
  <center><img src="/images/dh.jpg"></center>
</pre>

<p>#[ ANALYSIS ] :</p>
<p>As described above, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a means of generating a shared secret between two individuals (i.e. Alice and Bob) without it being known to external ‘observers’/‘listeners’ on the communication channel (i.e. Eve) even though a large portion of exchanged data that generated the shared secret is known. The D-H key exchange is not encryption, but a foundation to public key/asymmetric cryptography.</p>
<p>The resulting shared secret devised via D-H key exchange is never saved, nor is it transmitted or made visible by any means. The descriptive term of this is known as Forward Secrecy (FS), which usually exists as a successor product derived from the use of non-deterministic algorithms. The non-deterministic algorithm incorporated within the D-H protocols generates trap-door functions, which in return facilitates what is known as the discrete logarithm problem. This means, that it’s easy to mathematically compute the shared secret one-way, but incredibly difficult to reverse the computation to determine the initial secret values, especially if the shared numerical secret is a large number (as later demonstrated).</p>
<p>#[ THE MECHANICS ] :</p>
<p><b>0x01:</b><br> A prime value (<b>p</b>) and a primitive root modulo generator (<b>g</b>) are devised, and shared publicly between Alice and Bob.</p>
<p><b>0x02:</b><br> Alice and Bob then both randomly select their private/secret value, <b>a</b> (Alice’s), and <b>b</b> (Bob’s) of which is only known to themselves.
<p><b>0x03:</b><br> Alice computes <b>A</b> = <b>ga</b> mod <b>p</b> and sends the result of <b>A</b> publicly to Bob<p>
<p><b>0x04:</b><br> Likewise, Bob does incurs the same process and computes <b>B</b> = <b>gb</b> mod <b>p</b> and sends the result of B publicly to Alice.
<p><b>0x05:</b><br> Alice then takes the computational value of Bob’s public result, <b>B</b> and raises it to the power of her private number <b>a</b> and, therefore, solves <b>S</b> = <b>Ba</b> mod p</b>, where S</b> is the shared secret.
<p><b>0x06:</b><br> Likewise, Bob performs the same operation with Alice’s public computed result, <b>A</b>, by raising it to the power of his private number <b>b</b> and, therefore, solves S</b> = <b>Ab</b> mod p</b>, where <b>S</b> is the shared secret.

<p>A common shared secret between Alice and Bob has now been devised in secrecy, where the value computed in step 5) is identical to the resulting computed value in step <b>0x06</b>).</p>
<p>We can understand, with further mathematical analysis, as to how Alice and Bob both received the same value, being S, via different variable computations. This is achievable via the existing properties of modular arithmetic exponents. Of which is that, the resulting computed values are identical to each other despite the order of the calculated exponentiation:</p>
<pre class="hack dark">
  <center>(<b>g<sup>a</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)<b><sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b> ≅ <b>g<sup>ab</sup></b> mod <b>p</b> ≅ (<b>g<sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)<b><sup>a</sup></b> mod <b>p</b> = <b>g<sup>ba</sup></b> mod <b>p</b></center>
</pre>	   

<p>#[ DEMONSTRATION WITH SMALL NUMERICAL VALUES ] :</p>	  
For demonstration purposes, small numerical values have been used. These given values are as follows:

<pre class="hack dark">
Prime modulus (<b>p</b>) = 17,		
Primitive root modulo generator (<b>g</b>) = 3,
Alice’s private value (<b>a</b>) = 15,	
Bob’s private value (<b>b</b>) = 13
</pre>
Alice’s Public Value (<b>A</b>) is computed via:
<pre class="hack dark">
3<sup>15</sup> mod 17 = 6 	(<b>A</b> = <b>g<sup>a</sup></b> mod <b><sup>p</sup></b>)
</pre>
Bob’s Public Value (B) is computed via:
3<sup>13</sup> mod 17 = 12 	(<b>B</b> = <b>g<sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)
</pre>
<p>… And now the exchange:</p>
<p>Alice Computes the Shared Secret (<b>S</b>) via:</p> 
<pre class="hack dark">
12<sup>15</sup> mod 17 = 10 	(<b>S</b> = <b>B<sup>a</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)
</pre>
Bob Computes the Shared Secret (<b>S</b>) via:
<pre class="hack dark">
6<sup>13</sup>mod 17 = 10 	(<b>S</b> = <b>A<sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)
</pre>
<p>The shared secret (<b>S</b>) is now devised between Alice and Bob, in this case, being <b>10</b>’.</p>
<p>At it’s initial appearance, it may not seem like it, but Alice and Bob did the same calculation:</p>
<pre class="hack dark">
12<sup>15</sup> mod 17 ≅ 6<sup>13</sup> mod 17					(<b>S</b> = <b>B<sup>a</b> mod <b>p</b> ≅ <b>S</b> = <b>A<sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)
</pre>
<p>For example, considering Alice, the value ‘12’ that she received from Bob (B) was calculated via 12 = 3<sup>13</sup> mod 17. Therefore her calculation is the same as:</p>
<pre class="hack dark">
(3<sup>13</sup>)<sup>15</sup> mod 17 ≅ 3<sup>13*15</sup> mod 17
</pre>
For example, considering Bob, the value ‘6’ that he received from Alice (<b>A</b>) was calculated via: 6 = 3<sup>15</sup> mod 17. Therefore, his calculation is the same as:
<pre class="hack dark">
(3<sup>15</sup>)13 mod 17 ≅ 3<sup>15*13</sup> mod 17
</pre>
Which means, these two equations are congruent to each other:
<pre class="hack dark">
(<b>g<sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)<b><sup>a</sup></b> mod <b>p</b> = <b>g<sup>ba</sup></b> mod <b>p</b> ≅ (<b>g<sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>)<b><sup>a</sup><b></b> mod <b>p</b> = <b>g<sup>ba</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>
&there4; (3<sup>13</sup> mod 17)<sup>15</sup> mod 17 = 3<sup>13*15</sup> mod 17 ≅ (3<sup>15</sup> mod 17)<sup>13</sup> mod 17 = 3<sup>15*13</sup> mod 17
</pre>
<p>So Alice computes the value in one order, and Bob computes it in the other. Alice never knows Bob’s secret value used to calculate the result, nor does Bob ever know Alice’s used secret value yet both Alice and Bob arrive with the same resulting value. We can be confidently certain that neither Eve nor anybody else but Alice and Bob know the generated secret key. This secret key can now be used as a cryptographic encryption key for any encryption algorithm that incorporates shared secrets to parse mathematical functions that alter original plaintext to the corresponding cipher text and vice versa according to the mathematical ‘rules’ associated/devised with the secret key’s value.</p>
<p><b>Eve’s Observations if Intercepting the Public Channel’s Data Traffic During the Exchange</b></p>
<p>The values transmitted publicly via an insecure channel are: 6 (<b>A</b>), 12 (<b>B</b>), 3 (<b>g</b>), and 17(<b>p</b>). Depending on the size of the values, particularly the prime modulus (<b>p</b>), without one of the private/secret values, 15 (<b>a</b>) or 13 (<b>b</b>), Eve will be unable to solve the resulting shared secret solution (<b>S</b>). However, as stated above, small number values have been incorporated for demonstration purposes. These values are much larger in a real world-simulating environment which in turn enhances the impracticality to solve <b>S</b> without <b>a</b>, or, <b>b</b> via reverse mathematics. This leads to the <b>discrete logarithm problem</b>.</p>

<p>#[ THE DISCRETE LOGARITHM PROBLEM ] :</p>
<p>The discrete logarithm problem associated with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is as follows: </p>
<pre class="hack dark">
<center>“Given y, find x so that g x mod p = y”</center>
</pre>
<p><i>With small values, it’s quite simple:</i></p>
<pre class="hack dark">
3<sup>29</sup> mod 17 = 12 (easy trap-door function)
3<sup>x</sup> mod 17 = 12 (harder to reverse but not difficult. It’s just a matter of trial and error)
</pre>
<p><i>With large values, it becomes computationally intractable:</i></p>
<p>Suppose the prime modulus <b>p</b> has a length of 1024-bits (~ 308 base10/decimal digits), with <b>x</b> being known this is a simple trap-door function. However, without knowing <b>x</b>, <b>p</b>, being 1024-bits in length, is a value so large that it means there are <b>2<sup>1024</sup></b> possible combinations for <b>x</b>.</p>
<p>While such a discrete logarithm problem is traditionally used (<b>g<sup>x</sup></b> mod <b>p</b>), the general process of the D-H key exchange can be modified to use elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to form the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol (ECDH). A similar analysis on the ECDH protocol can be observed <a href="ecdh.htm">here.</href></p>
<p>#[ PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION FOR DEMONSTRATION ] :</p>
<pre class="hack dark">
from __future__ import print_function
 
sharedPrime = 23    # p
sharedBase = 5      # g
 
aliceSecret = 6     # a

print('Publicly Shared Variables:')
print('Publicly Shared Prime:', sharedPrime )
print('Publicly Shared Base:', sharedBase )
 
# Alice Sends Bob A = g^a mod p
A = (sharedBase**aliceSecret) % sharedPrime
print('\n Alice Sends Over Public Chanel:', A )
 
# Bob Sends Alice B = g^b mod p
B = (sharedBase ** bobSecret) % sharedPrime
print('Bob Sends Over Public Chanel:', B )
 
print( '\n------------\n')
print('Privately Calculated Shared Secret:')

# Alice Computes Shared Secret: s = B^a mod p
aliceSharedSecret = (B ** aliceSecret) % sharedPrime
print('Alice Shared Secret:', aliceSharedSecret )
 
# Bob Computes Shared Secret: s = A^b mod p
bobSharedSecret = (A**bobSecret) % sharedPrime
print('Bob Shared Secret:', bobSharedSecret )

<p>#[BREAKING DOWN THE SOURCE] :</p>
<p>The above is a Python implementation representing the ECDH key exchange protocol. This implementation presented is a segment of source-code that calculates the shared-secret in accordance to the multiplex of sub-scripts that perform and compute the group operations. Again, this source-code is incorporated for demonstration purposes using insecure values, including the curve that can easily be broken.</p>
<p>In short, as opposed to outlining the obvious and self-explanatory semantics of code line by line, a general overview of what is happening within this implementation is as follows:</p>
<p>The program initially imports subscripts and modules, including computations resulting from the sub-script elliptic.py, as well as Python's os module, which allows access to the operating system's Random Number Generator (RND) via the 'urandom' function that is used to generate both Alice and Bob's private keys.</p>
<p>Three functions are then defined: generateSecretKey, SendDH, and RecieveDH, all of which are later called.</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
5	  def generateSecretKey(numBits):
6	    return int.from_bytes(os.urandom(numBits // 8), byteorder='big')
7
8	  def sendDH(privateKey, generator, sendFunction):
9	    return sendFunction(privateKey * generator)
10
11	def receiveDH(privateKey, receiveFunction):
12	  return privateKey * receiveFunction()
</i>
</pre>
<p>The generateSecretKey function is called upon via, 'generateSecretyKey(8)' to generate a secret key each for Alice (aliceSecretKey) and Bob (bobSecretKey):</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
37	aliceSecretKey = generateSecretKey(8)
38	bobSecretKey = generateSecretKey(8)
</i>
</pre>
<p>The '8' is accepted as input to instruct the function to generate 8 random bytes (via os.urandom) to output a byte string object that is then converted to an integer value. Thus, a random value is generated for Alice and Bob's secret key.</p>
<p>The simple and therefore non-secure elliptic curve being used in the protocol's implementation is defined by y2 = x3 +324x + 1287 over the finite field &Zeta;/3851:</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
25	    F = FiniteField(3851, 1)
26
27	    # Totally insecure curve: y^2 = x^3 + 324x + 1287
28	    curve = EllipticCurve(a=F(324), b=F(1287))
</i>
</pre>
<p>A base point (basePoint) is chosen (920, 303) that will be used as a generator:</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
30	    # order is 1964
31	    basePoint = Point(curve, F(920), F(303))
</i>
</pre>
<p>These values are then called within the relevant functions with placeholders for actual network transmission functions. These functions are SendDH, and RecieveDH. These two functions mimic 'SendData' and have been derived for the purpose of simulating such network transmission. Both Alice and Bob call these functions as seen below:</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
37	 alicePublicKey = sendDH(aliceSecretKey, basePoint, lambda x:x)
38	 bobPublicKey = sendDH(bobSecretKey, basePoint, lambda x:x)
39
40	 sharedSecret1 = receiveDH(bobSecretKey, lambda: alicePublicKey)
41	 sharedSecret2 = receiveDH(aliceSecretKey, lambda: bobPublicKey)
</i>
</pre>
<p>alicePublicKey is computed with variables: aliceSecretKey and basePoint where the result is transmitted to Bob to compute sharedSecret1 with his private value (bobSecretKey). Likewise, bobPublicKey is computed with variables: bobSecretKey and basePoint where it is then transmitted to Alice to compute sharedSecret2 with her private value (aliceSecretKey). A shared secret point (x and y co-ordinate) on the curve has now been devised between Alice and Bob.</p>
<p>The x co-ordinate is extracted, and the corresponding integer is now the shared secret between Bob and Alice.</p>

<p>#[FINAL COMMENTS ON IMPLEMENTATION] :</p>
<p>The above implementation is successful with its accuracy in demonstrating a representation that portrays how the Elliptic Curve D-H key exchange mechanism works. Though it is not an applicable implementation that should be implemented.</p>
<p>The implementation offers insight as to how the protocol works. It's similar to the conventional D-H protocol, though the mathematical functions differ. These functions have been clearly showcased within the vast implementation scripts of the ECDH implementation.
<p>Similarly to the conventional D-H, for this implementation to contain a higher level of accuracy, the following must be considered:</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
1.	The use of insecure curves are not be used. Instead, Curves that have been assessed and tested
	by mathematical professionals should be incorporated for security.

2.	The use of small integers and values are not be used. Again, this relates to the security of
	the secret values devised by the ECDH protocol.

3.	The saving, printing or transmission of secret values should not occur.

4.	In a real-world simulation, no values are ever printed as seen in the implementation.
	Instead they are transmitted between the two parties (Alice and Bob).

5.	Public keys/values would actually functionally transmit across a network medium.

6.	Once devised, the shared secret value should parse hash functions.
